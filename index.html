                <p>Git is a <b>distributed version control system(DVCS).</b> Version control, also known as source control, is the
                    practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help
                    software teams manage changes to source code over time.Distributed version control is a form of version control
                    in which the complete codebase, including its full history, is
                    mirrored on every developer's computer.
                    <br />
                    Git does not rely on any central server and that is why you can perform many operations when you are offline.
                    You can commit changes, create branches, view logs(we will cover those terms shortly) and perform other
                    operations while offline. You require a network connection only to publish your changes and take the latest
                    changes from the remote repository(also to be covered shortly).
                    <br />
                    It uses SHA1 to name and identify objects within its database. Every file and commit is check-summed and
                    retrieved by its checksum at the time of checkout.

                <header>Git and Github</header>
                <p>There is a common misconception that git and github are one and the same thing. It is Important that we clear
                    this confusion before going ahead with the documentation.
                    <br />
                    Git and github perform different functions and serve different purposes. The two are not even owned by the same
                    company. Git is an open source tool maintained by the Linux Foundation. Github, by contrast is owned by
                    microsoft.
                    <br />
                    Git is a free, open-source software distributed version control system designed to manage all source code
                    history. It can keep a history of commits, can reverse changes, and lets developers share code. Each developer
                    must have git installed on his or her local device to collaborate.
                    <br />
                    GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. It offers all of Git’s
                    distributed version control system source code management and has some additional features. This includes
                    collaboration functionality like project management, support ticket management, and bug tracking. With GitHub,
                    developers can share their repositories, access other developers’ repositories, and store remote copies of
                    repositories to serve as backups.

                <header>DVCS Terminologies</header>
                <h2>Local Repository</h2>
                <p>Git provides a private workspace as a working copy. Developers make changes in their private workspace and after commit, these changes become part of the repository.</p>

                <h2>Working directory and staging area/index</h2>
                <p>The working directory is the place where the files are checked out.
                <br />
                Whenever you commit an operation, git looks for the files in the staging area. Only those files present in the staging area are considered for commit and not all the modified files. 
                <br /> 
                Thus this is the basic git workflow: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: modify a file from the working directory</li>
                    <li>Step 2: you add these files to the staging area</li>
                    <li>Step 2: you perform a commit operation that moves the files from the staging area. After push operation, it stores the changes permanently to the git  repository</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Blobs</h2>
                <p>Blob - Binary Large Object. Each version of a file is represented by a blob. A blob holds the file data but does not contain any metadata about the file. It is a binary file and in git database.</p>
                </p>

                <h2>Trees</h2>
                <p>An object which represents a directory. Holds blobs as well as other sub-directories.</p>

                <h2>Commits</h2>
                <p>A commit holds the current state of the repository. A commit is also named by SHA1 hash.</p>

                <h2>Branches</h2>
                <p>Branches are used to create another line of development. By default, git has a master branch. Usually a branch is created to work on a new feature. Once a feature is completed, it is merged back with the master branch and we delete the branch.</p>

                <h2>Tags</h2>
                <p>Tag asssigns a meaningful name with a specific version in the repository. Tags are similar to branches, but the difference is that tags are immutable.
                <br />
                Once a tag is created for a particular commit, even if you create a new commit, it will not be updated. Usually, developers create tags for product releases.
                </p>

                <h2>Clone</h2> 
                <p>Creates an instance of the repository.</p>

                <h2>Pull</h2>
                <p>Pull operations copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local one.</p>

                <h2>Push</h2>
                <p>Push operation copies changes from a local repository to a remote one. This is used to store the changes permanently into the git repository.</p>

                <h2>HEAD</h2>
                <P>HEAD is a pointer, which always points to the latest commit in the branch. Whenever you make a commit, HEAD is updated with the latest commit.
                <br />
                The heads of the branches are stored in <b>.git/refs/heads </b> directory.
                </P>

                <h2>Revision</h2>
                <p>Revision represents the version of the source code. Revisions in git are represented by commits. Commits are identified by SHA1 secure hashes.</p>

                <h2>URL</h2>
                <p>Represents the location of the git repository. Git url is stored in config file.</p>
