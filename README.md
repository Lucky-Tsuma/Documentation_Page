This was one of the projects I did while working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

Practiced on the following things:
1. How to give additional meaning to markup by using special div names such as: **main**, **header**, **footer**, **nav**, **ariticle**, **section**.
2. CSS media queries.
